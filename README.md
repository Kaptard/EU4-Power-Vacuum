# EU4-Power-Vacuum
A Meiou and Taxes submod that makes the AI actually compete with you.

<br>

### What this does
This mod fixes the AI's reluctance to do almost anything in the game on their own,
while also heavily improving the pacing of your gameplay.

For a short overview:
- Power vacuums won't stay around until you fill in the place. Expect the AI to
  challenge your interests by conquering or guaranteeing nations in weak alliance
  blocks.
  
- Rival nations (based on opinion) raiding each other is significantly more probable
  now. This means that the AI will actually declare war on you as well, even if you're
  slightly stronger. (Although they still won't attack huge alliance blocks that they can't beat)
  
- Armies with strong per-unit combat ability will now actually challenge armies that are
  larger in numbers (1.7 ratio to 0.9)
  
- The AI actually develops provinces now. For some reason the mod authors of M&T
  seem to have misunderstood the AI willingness factors, which led to AI never
  building anything.
  
- Starter buildings are much cheaper. This should greatly speed up early-game province
  development and result in more realistic population numbers towards the end of the game.
